<b>File Metadata Microservice</b><br>
freeCodeCamp File Metadata Microservice Basejump

<b>Objective:</b> Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to <a href="https://aryanj-file-size.herokuapp.com/">this</a>: and deploy it to Glitch.

Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit <a href="https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects">this</a>.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

<b>User Story:</b>  I can submit a FormData object that includes a file upload.

<b>User Story:</b>  When I submit something, I will receive the file size in bytes within the JSON response

<b>Hint:</b>  You may want to use this package: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/Multer">multer</a>

<b>Example usage:</b><br>
<code>https://ms1-fm-micro.glitch.me/</code><br>

<b>Example output:</b><br>
<code>{"size":322908}</code>
